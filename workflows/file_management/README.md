- **file_versioning.har** - Record file version management

## üöÄ Usage

After recording HAR files and generating workflows:

```bash
# Generate workflow from HAR
python3 HARFIles/har_to_workflow.py your_file.har YourWorkflowName file_management

# Test the workflow
export TEST_DATA_CSV=config/test_data_staging.csv
locust -f guidex_loadtest.py YourWorkflowNameUser --users=5 --spawn-rate=1
```

## üìÅ File Organization

```
file_management/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md                    # This file
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ workflow_name_user.py        # Generated workflow files
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ __init__.py                  # Python module initialization
```

## üéØ Priority

- **High**: Core file operations (upload/download)
- **Medium**: File sharing and organization
- **Low**: Advanced features like versioning

## üìù Recording Instructions

### File Upload (HIGH PRIORITY)
1. Record various file upload scenarios:
   - Single file uploads (PDF, DOC, images)
   - Multiple file uploads
   - Drag and drop uploads
   - Upload progress and validation
   - Upload error handling

### File Download (HIGH PRIORITY)
1. Record file download workflows:
   - Direct file downloads
   - Bulk file downloads
   - File preview before download
   - Download from different contexts (project, messages, etc.)

### File Sharing (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
1. Record file sharing workflows:

   - Shared folder management

### File Organization (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
1. Record file organization workflows:
   - Creating file folders

   - File categorization and tagging
   - File search and filtering

### Large File Handling (LOW PRIORITY)
1. Record large file operations:
   - Uploading files >10MB
   - Large file download performance
   - Progress tracking for large files
   - Timeout and retry scenarios

### File Versioning (LOW PRIORITY)
1. Record file version management:
   - Uploading new file versions
   - Viewing version history
   - Downloading specific versions
   - Version comparison workflows

## üìù Notes

- Test different file types and sizes
- Include error scenarios (file too large, unsupported format)
- Test concurrent file operations
- Consider mobile file operations
- Focus on upload/download performance under load
- Test file storage limitations and quotas
